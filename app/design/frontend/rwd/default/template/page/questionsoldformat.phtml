</div>

<div class="paragraph">It has now been proven that food can reverse diabetes. However making this food is very hard, time consuming.&nbsp;<br><br>Simple, we take care of all the work, the planning and of course the scientific research to give you daily therapeutic meals.<br><br>These meals are customized to your medical needs, for example :<ul><li>Some Diabetics Are Not Obese and Actually Need To Gain Weight</li><li>Some Diabetics Have Kidney Diseases</li><li>Some Diabetics Are Heart Patients</li><li>Some Diabetics Are Pregnant</li></ul><br>These meals are then planned under the medical supervision of an endocrinologist.<br><br>&#8203;Medications are usually lowered within 12 hours and we have seen in many cases that insulin use has dropped 75% within 4 days of starting our program.<br><br></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Will It Help Me?</h2>

<div class="paragraph">We have seen improvements in 99% of our clients. Medications are reduced within 12 hours of starting the program. The results are visible thanks to the most advanced glucose monitoring technology we use.<br><br>Clinically scientists have proven that 86% of patients returned to "non-diabetic biochemical marker without the need for drugs" in a study published last year in The Lancet. It is called the DiRECT study.<br><br>This program will help you if you are :<ul><li>Type II Diabetic</li><li>Type I Diabetic</li><li>Gestational Diabete</li><li>Obese</li></ul><br>Senior Clients: We will be more helpful to someone who has been diabetic for a shorter time versus someone who has been diabetic for 30 years and their pancreas are burnt out. In those extreme cases our program is still helping but it takes longer time and the clients will probably not return to a complete non-diabetic state. They will still see medication reductions which we are finding in 99% of clients and this helps them protect their kidneys and cardiovascular system.</div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">How Long Does It Take?</h2>

<div class="paragraph">Medication reduction begins within 12 hours.<br><br>How long it takes depends on various factors :<ul><li>Length of being diabetic</li><li>How obese they are</li><li>Other complications</li><li>How much they cheat or stick with the program</li><li>How much they exercise or if they are able to exercise</li><li>Your genes</li></ul><br>In a simple nutshell, if most diabetics came down to their ideal body weight, together with the nutrition boost to revitalize their pancreas, they are likely to become non-diabetic. <br><br>&#8203;For weight loss we target 1 kg a week, so if someone is 20kgs over their ideal body weight it will be a 20 -24 weeks program. It is good to add a 4 week buffer while planning and be realistic.<br></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">What Happens At End?</h2>

<div class="paragraph">At the end of the program you will return to your home food.<br><br>Let us explain.<br><br>THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REVERSAL FOODS AND THE MAINTENANCE FOODS.<br>Cooking and eating to maintain your health is far easier. We will give you a program which can be achieved within a normal home's cooking possibilities and time. What we cook in our kitchen is very hard to do in a home setting. It takes many many professional chefs, it takes special equipment and special training.<br><br>At home you will not have so much time, your chefs might leave and you will have new chefs. So we will leave you with a health maintenance plan. You will yourself be so aware of new foods and new items to eat that it will become easy to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>Just the reversal diet is close to impossible to do at home. The maintenance diet is not as hard.<br></div>

<div class="paragraph">If you return to a non-diabetic state it means you are non diabetic. It means your body is able to control your sugar levels, and keep them within 70 - 140 range like a non-diabetic person.<br><br>However if you return to doing the things which made you diabetic before, you will likely return to being diabetic again.<br><br>&#8203;We will make you healthy and teach you how to stay healthy. The rest will depend on you.</div>
