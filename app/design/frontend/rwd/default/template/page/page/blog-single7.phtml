				<h2>Tips To Reduce Processed Food </h2>
				
				
				<p>There is no denying that since the past 5 years, our dependence on processed food has increased. It all started with 2 min maggie (instant noodles) cheat snacks and finally become a permanent part of our lives. Processed foods are present everywhere around us, and we reach out for them without much thought. Some may not even know that the Real mango juice they are drinking is actually processed. So to set the record straight, what exactly is processed food? Processed foods are food products that have been cooked, frozen, canned, and packaged.  </p>
				
<p>It is realistically impossible to eliminate all kinds of processed foods from your diet. However, you must avoid highly processed foods loaded with sugar, salt, additives, and preservatives. Reducing consumption of processed food helps with weight loss and enhances your overall health and well-being. It can be confusing and overwhelming to cut out processed foods from your life. Here are some of the sustainable ways that you can use to reduce processed food: 
</p>
			<p><strong>Switch to whole grains: </strong>One of the easiest ways to reduce processed food is but cutting out refined grains from your life. Minor differences make a significant impact when it comes to health. Replace your white pasta, rice, bread, taco shells, naan, and kulchas with whole grains. Trust us, brown bread tastes equally good and has lots of health benefits. Whole grains are full of fiber and help improve your metabolic rate. They are also suitable for heart diseases, diabetes, and blood pressure.  </p>
				<p><strong>Spice up your daily meals:</strong> Why eat the boring wheat chapati when you can replace it with healthier alternatives like ragi, millet, bajra, and others. Spice things even further by trying out lettuce wraps or lettuce burgers instead of your dull, bland, processed bun and tortilla. Make Chinese food without frying your vegetables, and best of all, replace your regular fries with sweet potato fries. There are plenty of ways to spice up healthy eating, and some of the best secrets can be found at Lifeheal. </p>

<p><strong>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables:</strong> There is absolutely nothing that can replace the benefits of eating fresh fruits and vegetables. A healthy meal should include at least a portion of fresh fruits and vegetables. Try adding spinach, carrots, and beets in your pav bhaji. Try including a small bowl of salad with your lunch and dinner. Eating a small bowl of salad can make you full, ensuring you don't overeat during meals. </p>

<p><strong>Load up on healthy snacks:</strong> Eating fried chips, cookies, and bhujiya can easily ruin your health and diet. It may sound impossible but eating healthy snacks is quite doable. There are plenty of snacks out there that are healthier than their counterparts. You can stock up your pantry with loads of nuts, dried fruits, hummus, makhanas, rice puffs, khakhras, and other non-fried food. You can also try making your DIY healthy snacks at home. As always, Lifeheal has plenty of these in their pandora's box. </p>

<p><strong>Drink loads of water:</strong> The importance of water and staying hydrated can't be emphasized enough. Proper hydration helps avoid fatigue, lethargy, mood swing, and headaches. It also cleanses your body and rejuvenates your skin. It is excellent for muscle recovery and oxidation post-workout. And finally, drinking water before meals ensures you don't overeat, and it keeps you full longer. </p>

<p><strong>Read labels:</strong> If you haven't been doing this already, then you should start reading labels. Did you know that flavored yogurts have added sugar? So, though they might be low cal, the added sugar is harmful while losing weight. Additionally, a lot of packaged nuts are roasted in vegetable oil, which can impact your health. </p>

<h3>Bottom Line: </h3>

<p>It may seem not easy to live in a world with processed food, but it is totally doable. Make sure to keep healthy snacks at hand for those hunger purges and try cooking something new. If you're still unsure, Lifeheal's got your back. There are plenty of ideas for spicing up your meals and snacks out there. </p>
