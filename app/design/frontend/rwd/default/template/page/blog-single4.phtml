				<h2>How To Improve Your Gut</h2>
				<img src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/Blog4img1.jpeg') ?>"/>
				
				<p>Did you know that our body has over 4 trillion bacteria? Interestingly most of them can be found in the gut. Our gut microbiome has around 300-400 varieties of bacteria, and it's imperative to maintain a balanced gut biome. Since the last couple of years, researchers have indicated a direct correlation between gut health and immune system, mood, skin problems, mental health, autoimmune diseases, and endocrine system. A lot of parts of our modern life have contributed to poor gut health. Increasing stress, less sleep, high sugar food, eating processed food, and stress all increase chances of the poor gut. </p>
				<h3>The most common signs of poor gut health are:</h3>
				
				<p><b>Upset stomach:</b> Stomach problems such as gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and acidity are some of the first signs of an upset stomach and gut. All these problems indicate a lower and improper functioning gut. </p> 

<p><b>High Sugar diet:</b> Eating a high sugar diet reduces the gut biome and reduces the efficiency of good gut bacteria. High fructose corn syrup is one of the biggest culprits of gut imbalance and can even increase gut inflammation. </p>

<p><b>Unintentional weight loss:</b> Sudden weight loss is another prominent symptom of poor gut health. A disturbed gut can find it hard to absorb necessary nutrients, regulate sugar and fat storage. </p> 

<p><b>Sleep issues and fatigue:</b> An imbalanced gut can cause sleep disturbances, leading to significant fatigue. Serotonin, a sleep hormone, is produced in the gut, and an imbalanced gut can affect its normal functionality. </p>

<p><b>Autoimmune conditions:</b> Recently, many research papers have found a connection between poor gut health and a weak immune system. Studies have shown that an imbalanced gut can lead to inflammation, which causes significant damage to the immune system.  </p>


				
				<h3>How do I improve my gut?</h3>
				<p>In addition to getting enough sleep and reducing stress, food plays a major role in improving gut health. Eat gut-friendly food is one of the best and easiest ways to improve your gut health. There are plenty of foods readily available that can help improve your gut health and save you from a lot of other health conditions. Here are some of the food you should incorporate while trying to improve your gut:</p>

			<p><b>High Fibre Food:</b> According to many studies, high fiber foods are some of the best foods that help improve gut health. They keep you full for longer and improve your metabolism. Make sure to eat plenty of foods like legumes, oats, beans, peas, bananas, berries, asparagus, and leek. </p>

<p><b>High Fibre Food:</b> One of the gut's primary functions is to improve the immune system and avoid getting cancer. Onion and garlic both have some anti-cancer and immune-boosting properties. These foods also contain prebiotic food that helps restore the gut biome. </p>

<p><b>Fermented food:</b> Fermented foods are a great source of probiotics and arguably one of the best foods to have for gut health. Probiotics improve the gut microbiome and your metabolism. Some probiotics to have in your pantry are kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, kefir, tempeh, miso, and kombucha. </p>
				<p><b>Polyphenol-rich foods</b>Foods rich in polyphenols have several health benefits, such as reduction of blood pressure, inflammation, and cholesterol levels. Ensure to consume polyphenol-rich foods like cocoa and chocolate, red wine, almonds, green tea, and blueberries. </p>

<p>Our gut bacteria are essential for maintaining proper health. Whether they are small, like bloating, or significant, like a weak immune system, the bottom is that we can't ignore gut health. A disturbed gut can lead to many problems. A holistic approach is required while restoring gut health. Make sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, prebiotic and probiotic foods. Make sure to avoid processed food, high sugar foods, reduce stress, and get enough sleep.
