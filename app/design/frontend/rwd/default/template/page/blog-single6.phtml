				<p>We’ve all seen celebrities carry a bottle of water with them. In fact, many have even preached and promoted the importance of staying hydrated. The human body comprises 60% of water, and it needs water to survive. Every organ and cell in our body needs to stay hydrated (with water) to work efficiently. Our daily consumption of water should be around nine 8-ounce or 2.5 to 3 liters of water. The importance of water can’t be ignored and brushed off. So grab a glass of water and continue reading the benefits of water: </p>
				
<p><strong>1. Affects energy levels and brain function:</strong> Dehydration has a significant impact on your body. Based on several studies, dehydration can impact mood, fatigue, concentration, memory, anxiety, and other brain functions. You may also feel lethargic and lazy when you’re parched. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay energized and active. 
</p>
			<p><strong>2. Improved physical performance:</strong> Hydration is crucial, especially during physical exercises. Physical activities such as running, cycling, workout, and other cause your body to lose water in the form of sweat. Thus, water helps prevent fatigue and keeps you energized. It also helps reduce oxidative stress during high-intensity workouts. </p>
<p><strong>3. Helps joints and muscle function:</strong> Ever cramped your joints? Did you know that cramps can occur because of dehydration? Your muscles and joints get tight without proper fluid. Thus, if you perform physical activity, it is highly recommended to stay hydrated. Water also helps replenish lost fluid in your muscles cells after an intense workout. It helps with protein synthesis, which may avoid the breakdown of muscle tissues. </p>
				<p><strong>4. Cleanses your body:</strong> Toxins enter our body every day, whether it’s intentional or not. It may enter our bodies in the form of air pollution, processed food, sugary drinks, etc. Water helps the kidney get rid of toxins from our blood and dispose of them outside our bodies. Drinking plenty of water ensures we are toxin-free and energized. </p>
				<p><strong>5. Boosts skin health and beauty:</strong> Water plays a crucial role in your skin health and beauty. Water helps maintain your pH levels, ensuring you have glowing and gorgeous skin. It may help avoid skin sagging, which is caused by the loss of fluids in your skin. Finally, it flushes out toxins that may cause severe acne and pimple, giving you flawless skin. </p>
				<p><strong>6. Natural appetite suppressant:</strong> Have you ever realized that you may feel hungry sometimes, but it’s because you’re dehydrated? Drinking water before meals works as a great appetite suppressant. It helps you feel fuller, ensuring you don’t eat that last pizza slice in the box. It also helps avoid sugary drinks that may rack up extra calories. So, next time you feel hungry, try drinking water instead. </p>
				<p><strong>7. Improve metabolism:</strong> Water accelerates fat and carbohydrate metabolism, ensuring necessary fat burn. It does so by combining with fat molecules to create glycerol and fatty acids. This expedites fat burn and improves metabolism. </p>
